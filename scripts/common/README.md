# Common/Shared Utilities

Shared code and utilities used across multiple weather models.

## Purpose

This directory contains base classes, shared configuration, and common functionality to avoid code duplication across different weather model scripts.

## Planned Modules

- `base_downloader.py` - Base class for all download scripts
- `config.py` - Shared configuration and constants
- `models.py` - Data models for forecast metadata

Part of future refactoring.
